                <h4>Gokarna Tourism</h4>
                <p>With its pristine beaches and breathtaking landscapes, Gokarna is a Hindu pilgrimage town in Karnataka and a newly found hub for beach lovers and hippies.</p>
                <p>Situated on the coast of Karwar, Gokarna is a small town in Karnataka, primarily known for two reasons - its beaches and temples. Gokarna can be different things to different people. Every year hordes of tourists visit Gokarna in search of sanctity and salvation on one hand and respite and relaxation on the other. The out-of-town beaches are a curious contrast to the life inside the town. Palm clad beaches are dotted with foreign tourists in a majority and very few Indians are seen across. Gokarna is not very conventionally touristy. The beaches are meant for a slow, relaxed holiday and everything on the beach goes at the same relaxed pace. Full of coconut and palm trees, the ocean and clean sands, Gokarna is a 'one of its kind place' in the country. </p>
